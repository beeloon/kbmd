| Option | Description |
| :------: | :----------- |
| -p | Show the patch introduced with each commit. |
| --stat | Show statistics for files modified in each commit. |
| --shortstat | Display only the changed/insertions/deletions line from the --stat command. |
| --name-only | Show the list of files modified after the commit information. |
| --name-status | Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well. |
| --abbrev-commit | Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40. |
| --relative-date | Display the date in a relative format (for example, “2 weeks ago”) instead of using the full date format. |
