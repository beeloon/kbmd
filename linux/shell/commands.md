## ps

```bash
ps

# list all running processes
ps -e

# shows the names of all the running processes, their process identification numbers (PIDs), 
# the PIDs of their parents (PPIDs), when they began (STIME), what terminal, if any, they're attached to (TTY), 
# how much CPU time they've racked up (TIME), and their full path names
ps -ef

# the same as ps
ps aux
```

## kill (killall)
The kill command sends a signal to specified processes or process groups, causing them to act according to the signal. When the signal is not specified, it defaults to -15 (-TERM).
The most commonly used signals are:

1 (HUP) - Reload a process.
9 (KILL) - Kill a process.
15 (TERM) - Gracefully stop a process.

```bash
# will gracefully stop process 
kill <process pid>

# will immediately kill process
kill -9 <process pid>

# will stop/kill all process with <name>
killall <name>
killall -9 node
```

## chmod
change file mode bits

chmod can be used with [numeric permissions](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/unix-linux-bsd-chmod-numeric-permissions-notation-command/) mode

```bash
# make file executable
chmod +x sample.txt

# Read by owner only 
chmod 400 sample.txt 

# Read by group only
chmod 040 sample.txt 

# Read by anyone
chmod 004 sample.txt 

# Write by owner only
chmod 200 sample.txt 

# Write by group only
chmod 020 sample.txt 

# Write by anyone
chmod 002 sample.txt 

# Execute by owner only
chmod 100 sample.txt 

# Execute by group only
chmod 010 sample.txt 

# Execute by anyone
chmod 001 sample.txt 

# Allow read permission to owner and group and anyone.
chmod 444 sample.txt

# Allow everyone to read, write, and execute file.
chmod 777 sample.txt
```

## history
The history command show a list of used commands with their id

```bash
history
!2

# if you want to run command from the end of the list
# you can also use negative numbers
!-5 

# we can use command symbols to run the last command
# that match these symbols
!find
!git

# If you want to check which command will be used
# before runneng it, you  can specify :p option
# it stands for 'print', and show the whole command text
!git:p

# If you want to use arguments of certain command
# for another command you can use this with !*
# eg. will replace !5157* to arguments that was used
# with command which id 5157 in history (eg. kill -9 node)
kill !5157*
# the same example, without command history id
# !* will return arguments of the last command you have used
killall -9 node
kill !*
# or check how command will look with arguments from
# another command
kill !*:p
# you can also specify certain argument by it index
# eg. will return => cat file2.txt
cp file1.txt file2.txt
cat !:2
# or you can specify range or arguments
# eg. will return 2,3,4 arguments => -f -h -F
ls -a -f -h -F
!:2-4

# to pick last argument of some command use !$
# for first argument use !^
# eg. return last argument of ls that was matched to last ls command in history
!ls:$

# eg. return all arguments from 2 to the last one
ls !ls:2-$
```

## && (AND)
Run a sequence of commands  
```bash
# will got to api/coupon dir and then run start script
cd api/coupon && npm start

# if one of the command in sequence will throw an error
# next commands in sequence will not run
# eg. throw an error when making a directory and won't run cd command
mkdir /root/mydir && cd /root/mydir
```

## || (OR)
Run the first command that will not throw an error 
```bash
# will not create new dir, but will try to go to /root/mydir dir 
mkdir /root/mydir || cd /root/mydir
```

## unzip 
list, test and extract compressed files in a ZIP archive
```bash
# will unzip ARCHIVE.zip 
unzip [ARCHIVE.zip]
```

## gzip
gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files
```bash
# will unzip ARCHIVE.zip and then delete ARCHIVE.zip
gzip [ARCHIVE.zip]
```

## zip
package and compress (archive) files
```bash
# archive n file to ARCHIZE.zip
zip [ARCHIVE.zip] file1, file2, ..., fileN
```

## gzip
gzip, gunzip, zcat - compress or expand files
```bash
# will archive [FILE] to FILE.gz archive and delete original [FILE]
gzip [FILE]
```

## du
estimate file space usage
```bash
# -h - human readable form
# -d - print the total for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N  or  fewer  levels  below  the  command  line  argument; --max-depth=0 is the same as --summarize
du [-d|-h] path
```

## df
report file system disk space usage
```bash
# -h - human readable form
df [-h]
```
